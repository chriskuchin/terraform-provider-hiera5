	// have. It's the finders responsibility to obtain the value. The finder must return nil when the
	// value could not be found.
	//
	// A finder can return a Map where the given key is one of multiple keys in case the finder wants
	// to make more elements known to the loader. The given key is required in such a map.
	//
	// The key sent to the finder will never be a multi part name. It will reflect a single name that is
	// relative to the loader that the Finder is configured for.

	// responsibility to create the Loader that represents the new namespace. The creator must return
	// nil when no such namespace can be created.

	// that the name must contain no '/' characters since they separate the name from its namespace.
	// A load involving a nested name must use the Load method.
